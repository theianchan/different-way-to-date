          <h1>What's so <i>different</i> about it?</h1>

          <h2>Modern romance can be a lot of work.</h2>
          <p> And that work can be fun, sometimes, and you're actually pretty good at it, if you do say so yourself.</p>
          <p>But sending pizza heart GIFs, making dinner reservations (in this city!), keeping a running summary of trending topics and taboos, only to have to fake a work emergency in the middle of El Techo, <i>again</i>, because your date is getting an unsettingly intense gleam in their eye as they discuss the idea of Californian secession, <i>again</i>.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, you want someone else to <i>just take care of it</i></p>
          <p>You're in luck.</p>

          <h2> We screen the dates, pick the venue, and plan the night.</h2>
          <p>No flakes, no creeps, no catfish. Our seasoned social media stalkers comb Instagram, Medium, Gawker, Venmo, <i>real life</i> for the most interesting and attractive, single people in the city.</p>

          <h2> All you have to do... is show up.</h2>
